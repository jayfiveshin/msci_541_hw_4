two-sided, paired, statistical test
statistical test vs t-test (paired t-test is what I want to be using)
two-sided vs one-sided (I should be using two-sided because I want to
test for both better or worse results)
paired vs unpaired (I should be using paired because both results came
from the same sample)
signicance level (I should be using alpha = 0.05, or 5%)
p-value (probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as
actually observed, given null hypothesis is true)
computation (done)
