normalized version of dcg
dcg stands for discounted cumulative gain
two assumptions
1. some documents are more relevant than others
2. documents placed on top has more usage, similiarly documents placed
at the bottom is less useful since it is less likely for users to see
them
discount factor is typically x/log2(rank), where x is the level of
relevance
normalized means you divide the actual dcg value by the ideal dcg value
